We applied our youthvars and TTU modules to developing a [dataset of transfer to utility models](https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/DKDIB0) that can be used to predict adolescent weighted AQoL-6D health utility from a range of psychological distress, depression, anxiety and functioning predictors. Vignettes from the [youthu R package](https://ready4-dev.github.io/youthu/index.html) illustrate (using fake data) how these models can be used to derive Quality Adjusted Life Year predictions. A preprint describing this study is now available at: https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.07.07.21260129v3. The three toolkits, the dataset and the pre-print are outputs of the Spring To Life model of people.

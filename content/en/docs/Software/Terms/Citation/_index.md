To make it easier to cite our software, each software item bundle includes a CITATION.cff file. Inclusion of this file means that the repositories storing our software can generate appropriate citations in the format of most relevance to you. 

Currently:
 - [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org) provides a free text field under the heading “Cite as” which enables you to generate a wide range of citation manager and journal specific citation outputs. There is also an “Export” tool that will generate citation metadata in multiple output formats;
 - [OpenAire Explore](https://explore.openaire.eu) has a “Cite this software” button that allows you to generate a citation in multiple journal formats or to download BibTeX or RIS files;
 - [Github](https://github.com) repositories have a “Cite this repository” button that can generate both BibTeX and APA output as well as link to the Citation.cff file.

Additionally, we have included a CITATION file in each of our R [libraries](../../publications/libraries/) so that you can generate a citation from within an R session using the `citation` function (for example: `citation("ready4")`.

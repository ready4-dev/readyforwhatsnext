To help ensure the models we develop are as transparent as possible and to make their algorithms as useful to others as possible, all ready4 software is free and open-source. You are encouraged to make as widespread use of our software, including the creation of derivative works, as you see fit, so long as it is consistent with each item's license. Our software is typically licensed under [GPL-3](https://ready4-dev.github.io/ready4/LICENSE.html), a copy-left open-source licensing regime.

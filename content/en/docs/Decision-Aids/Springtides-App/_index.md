**The Springtides app is currently deprecated**, pending the release of a new version that is currently in development. An old ( ~2019) version of the app that was developed to aid testing and debugging is reproduced below **purely for illustrative purposes**. **We don't encourage use of this illustrative app to inform decision making** as the input data is now very dated and the current web based version often fails if generating large / or customised geometries. If you do wish try it out, we recommend that you **only select the default type of geometry ("Select from a menu of existing options")** as the web version is not configured to render custom geometries. To use the app you need to first confirm your selections in the "Where" tab, before confirming selections from the "What" box, then from the "Who" box and finally the "When" box before an orange box appears that gives you the option to generate a report. When trying this app out, we recommend keeping the number of simulations low (e.g. 10) as it takes several minutes for even small numbers of runs to execute.

description: >
  Modules to model the characteristics, relationships, behaviours, risk factors and outcomes of young people and individuals who interact with young people are collectively referred to as the "Spring To Life" sub-model. A table summarising Spring To Life [module libraries for modelling people](/docs/tutorials/finding/libraries/) is available. Additional information (e.g. tutorials and blog articles) about currently available Spring To Life modules is labelled with the ["model-modules-people"](/tags/model-modules-people/) tag. Resources about Spring To Life datasets are tagged with ["data-datasets-people"](/tags/data-datasets-people/). Brief information about additional [unreleased Spring To Life modules](/docs/getting-started/pipeline/pipeline-people/) that are in development is also available.

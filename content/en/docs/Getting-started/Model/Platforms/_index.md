description: >
  Modules that model the processes, eligibility requirements, staffing and configurations of youth service platforms are collectively referred to as the "First Bounce" sub-model. There is currently one First Bounce [module library for modelling platforms](/docs/tutorials/finding/libraries/) that is available but this is highly preliminary and lacks tutorials to demonstrate its use. There are also details on [unreleased work in progress](/docs/getting-started/pipeline/pipeline-platforms/).

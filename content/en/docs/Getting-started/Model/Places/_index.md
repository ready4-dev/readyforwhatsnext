description: >
  Modules for spatio-temporal modelling of the environments that shape young people's mental health are collectively referred to as the "Springtides" sub-model. Both Springtides [module libraries for modelling people](/docs/tutorials/finding/libraries/) that are available are highly preliminary and lack tutorials to demonstrate their use. A deprecated [app](/docs/model/analyses/decision-aids/springtides-app/) built using these libraries is available for illustration purposes.  Resources relating to preliminary and unreleased modules for the Springtides model is tagged with the ["model-modules-places"](/tags/model-modules-places/) tag and those relating to compatible datasets are tagged with ["data-datasets-places"](/tags/data-datasets-places/). Brief information on [unreleased work in progress module libraries](/docs/getting-started/pipeline/pipeline-places/) are also available.

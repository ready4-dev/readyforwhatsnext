We have no current pipeline of new module libraries for modelling programs (ie for the On Target sub-model). The currently released On Target libraries modules itemised in the summary table of [module libraries for modelling programs](/docs/tutorials/finding/libraries/) are highly preliminary and are therefore our focus for future development in this area.

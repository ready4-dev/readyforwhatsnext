Our current pipeline of modules for modelling people is principally focused on developing tools for:

- creating synthetic household datasets from multiple longitudinal datasets of varying structure, including modules specifically designed to streamline wrangling data from the HILDA and LSAC datasets (both from Australia); and

- implementing agent based model simulations.

A significant amount of work has already been completed on the first project and initial development releases of each, along with one scientific manuscript, are planned for late 2024.

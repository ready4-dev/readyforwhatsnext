Our current pipeline of modules for modelling places (from the Springtides sub-model) will extend the libraries listed in summary table of [module libraries for modelling places](/docs/tutorials/finding/libraries/) to:

- predict prevalence and incidence by area; and

- provide a user-interface (i.e. software to implement an updated version of the currently deprecated [Springtides app](/docs/model/analyses/decision-aids/springtides-app/)).

Although unreleased, the source code for the above projects has been used to [generate analysis during the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic](/blog/2021/02/18/modelling-the-mental-health-impacts-of-covid-19/). Initial development releases of places module libraries, along with an updated app, are anticipated in the second half of 2024.

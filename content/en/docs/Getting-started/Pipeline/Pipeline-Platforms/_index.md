Our current pipeline of modules for modelling platforms includes code for implementing:

- a discrete event simulation of primary mental health services for young people; 
- a simple cohort model of early psychosis services; and
- a blended (systems dynamics / discrete event simulation) model for optimising eligibility and referral policies across multiple services. 

The first two of the above models are currently implemented in R and are sufficiently advanced to produce exploratory analysis. However, neither are adequately documented or tested and need to be redeveloped as First Bounce sub-model modules and re-validated prior to development releases.  The optimisation model was implemented in Java and was populated with toy data - this will require more substantial development prior to public release.

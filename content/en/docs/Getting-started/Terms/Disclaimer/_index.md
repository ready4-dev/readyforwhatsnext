All readyforwhatsnext model software is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Furthermore, no readyforwhatsnext model software is yet sufficiently well documented and tested to be given a [production release](https://www.ready4-dev.com/docs/software/status/production-releases/). All readyforwhatsnext model software should therefore viewed as experimental [development releases](https://www.ready4-dev.com/docs/software/status/development-releases/).

  What you need in order to be able to use readyforwhatsnext model software on your machine.
---

Currently, all readyforwhatsnext model software is written in [R](https://www.r-project.org) (for model module libraries), [R Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) (for analysis programs and reporting sub-routines) and [JavaScript](https://www.javascript.com) (for the user interface component of [Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com) applications) using the [ready4 framework](https://www.ready4-dev.com/).

Therefore:

- to use readyforwhatsnext model module libraries and programs / subroutines you must have an up to date version of R and the [ready4](https://ready4-dev.github.io/ready4/) R library installed on your machine and it is recommended that you install the [RStudio IDE](https://posit.co/products/open-source/rstudio/); and

- the requirements for using readyforwhatsnext model user interfaces depend on whether you are running a version we have deployed to the web (in which case you just need a [supported browser](https://support.posit.co/hc/en-us/articles/221311328-Supported-browsers-for-Shiny-Server)) or whether you are running the app on your local machine (in which case you will need R, the ready4 library and RStudio).

Some examples of practical applications of ready4 include:

- Mapping psychological and functional measures to health utility for young people using primary mental health services (a [pre-print manuscript](https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.07.07.21260129), a [replication and results dataset](https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/DKDIB0), [replication code](/docs/analyses/replication-code/map-utility/) and R packages for [developing](https://ready4-dev.github.io/TTU/) and [applying](https://ready4-dev.github.io/youthu/) mapping models);
- Assessing the heterogeneity of quality of life in a clinical sample of young people (a [peer-reviewed manuscript](https://doi.org/10.1017/s2045796022000427) and [R package](https://ready4-dev.github.io/heterodox/) for exploring and characteristing heterogeneity in quality of life data); 
- Predicting the online helpseeking choices of socially anxious young people (an [R package](https://ready4-dev.github.io/mychoice/articles/mychoice.html) for designing and analysing discrete choice experiments, a [replication dataset](https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/VGPIPS) and [replication code](/docs/analyses/replication-code/model-choice/)); and
- Predicting the future spatial distribution of mental disorder in young people (a [policy briefing](../../blog/2021/02/18/modelling-the-mental-health-impacts-of-covid-19/), an [app](../analyses/decision-aids/springtides-app/) and a [dataset of sample reports](https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/V3OKZV) generated by the app).

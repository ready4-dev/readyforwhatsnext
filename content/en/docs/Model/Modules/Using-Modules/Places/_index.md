  Modules for spatio-temporal modelling of the environments that shape young people's mental health are collectively referred to as the "Springtides" sub-model. Two module libraries are currently available - [vicinity](https://ready4-dev.github.io/vicinity/) and [aus](https://ready4-dev.github.io/aus/), though both are highly preliminary and without any vignette articles to demonstrate their use. An [app](/docs/model/analyses/decision-aids/springtides-app/) built using a combination of these libraries and [unreleased work in progress module libraries](/docs/model/modules/pipeline/pipeline-places/) is available for illustration purposes.

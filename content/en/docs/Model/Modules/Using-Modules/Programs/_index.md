  Modules for modelling the efficacy, cost-effectiveness and budget impact of youth mental health programs (e.g. interventions for prevention, treatment and wellbeing) are collectively referred to as the "On Target" sub-model.  Some initial modules from the [costly](https://ready4-dev.github.io/costly/) library are available. There is also even more preliminary [work in progress](/docs/model/modules/pipeline/pipeline-programs/).

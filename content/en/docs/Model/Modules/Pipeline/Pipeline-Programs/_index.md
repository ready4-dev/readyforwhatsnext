A very early development release of [bimp](https://ready4-dev.github.io/bimp/index.html) - a library for undertaking budget impact analysis, is currently available. However, as bimp is largely untested, undocumented and highly preliminary (e.g. not yet implemented as ready4 modules), we have chosen not to list it in the summary table of readyforwhatsnext [model module libraries](/docs/model/modules/finding/libraries/).

description: "Using tools (soon to be formalised into ready4 framework modules) from the youthu R package, it is possible to use utility mapping algorithms to help implement cost-utility analyses. This tutorial illustrates the main steps for doing so using psychological and functional measures collected on clinical samples of young people."
